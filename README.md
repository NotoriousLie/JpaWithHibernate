# JPA with Hibernate

Sample project to learn some new things regarding JPA, Hibernate, H2, MySQL, Maven, Mockito, JSF 2.3 and Primefaces (this list is probably not all of it)

## Structure

This project has several subbranches:
* master (this current branch, more like a placeholder)
* development (project with MySQL implementation)
* feature-h2 (project with H2 in-memory implementation)

This project is far from over and will probably grow overtime. New projects will probably be linked here aswell.
